;;; Code:

;;; [ glasses-mode ] -- make CamelCase identifiers easy look.

;;; insert a virtual underscore separator between the conjoined words, so
;;; `fooBarBaz' will look like `foo_Bar_Baz'.
;;;
;;; When glasses-mode is enabled, you should continue following the CamelCase
;;; style as Emacs will automagically insert the virtual separator, as needed,
;;; when you type a capitalized character.
