;;; [ magit-gh-pulls ] -- allows you to conveniently manipulate Githubâ€™s pull requests from Emacs.

;;; Usage:
;;
;; 1. [# g g]
;;
;; In magit-status window press [# g g] to refresh the list of pull
;; requests. magit-gh-pulls automatically infers credentials from the URL of the
;; repository. If there are some PRs available, a new section will appear called
;; Pull Requests. Each item in this section has the following form:
;;
;;   [pull-request-number@branch-name] Pull request name
;;
;; 2. [# g f]
;;
;; Highlighting the desired PR and pressing [# g f] will fetch the commits
;; associated with the PR. These are the real commits that you can view, apply,
;; cherry-pick etc.
;;
;; 3. From this point magit-gh-pulls offers you two options:
;;
;; - press [# g b] on the PR to create a topic branch for this PR. After testing
;;   the PR you can merge it back into your branch using Magit.
;;
;; - press [# g m] to merge the PR on top of the currently checked out
;;   branch. This is convenient if pull request can be merged by fast-forwarding
;;   and no testing is needed (or you can test from your branch directly). A
;;   nice benefit of this approach over merging from Github interface is that in
;;   case of FF no merge commit is produced, so history stays nice and linear.

;; 1. auto turn on magit-gh-pulls
;; (require 'magit-gh-pulls)
;; (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)

;; 2. manually turn on magit-gh-pulls
;; (unless (fboundp 'magit-gh-pulls-mode)
;;   (package-install 'magit-gh-pulls))

;;; [ magit-gerrit ] -- Magit plugin for Gerrit Code Review

;;; Usage:
;;
;; -

;;; Workflow
;;
;; - Check out branch, make changes, and commit...
;; - Gerrit Push Commit for Code Review => T P
;; - Gerrit Add Reviewer => T A (optional)
;; - Wait for code review and verification (approvals updated in magit-status)
;; - Gerrit Submit Review => T S

(require 'magit-gerrit)

;;; For simple setups, it should be enough to set the default value for
;;; `magit-gerrit-ssh-creds' and `magit-gerrit-remote'.
;;
;;; if remote url is not using the default gerrit port and
;;; ssh scheme, need to manually set this variable
;; (setq-default magit-gerrit-ssh-creds "myid@gerrithost.org")
;;
;;; if necessary, use an alternative remote instead of 'origin'
;; (setq-default magit-gerrit-remote "gerrit")

;;; For per project configurations, consider using buffer local or directory local variables.
