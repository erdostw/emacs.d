;;; FAQ
;; How to use a non-graphical password prompt for gpg?
;;
;; In X, Emacs 23 seems to pop up a graphical window to ask you the
;; keyphrase. How to let it ask the password in minibuffer?
;;
;; I found the cause for it. The graphical window appears if you run gpg with
;; the --use-agent option. EasyPG adds it (see epg.el) if it sees an environment
;; variable like this one:
;; GPG_AGENT_INFO=/tmp/seahorse-nDQm50/S.gpg-agent:6321:1 (check that with the
;; env command). And you have this variable if for instance you have the program
;; seahorse installed and running (which is the case in Ubuntu). If you
;; uninstall Seahorse, the prompt will always be text instead of graphical. You
;; may have to relogin to X to force Seahorse to close.
