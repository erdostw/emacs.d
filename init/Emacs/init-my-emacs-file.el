;;; [ DovView mode ]

;; Emacs utility for viewing PDF/PS/DVI/OpenDocument/Microsoft Office documents files in Emacs.
;; Usage:
;; When you visit a document file that can be displayed with DocView mode, Emacs auto use DocView mode.
;; - [M-x doc-view]
;; - `doc-view-clear-cache' :: to delete all cached files.
;; - `doc-view-dired' :: for Dired users.

;;; large file

;;; [ vlf -- View Large Files ]

;;; Emacs minor mode that allows viewing, editing, searching and comparing large
;;; files in batches, trading memory for processor time. Batch size can be
;;; adjusted on the fly and bounds the memory that is to be used for operations
;;; on the file. This way multiple large files (like terabytes or whatever) can
;;; be instantly and simultaneously accessed without swapping and degraded
;;; performance.

;;; Usage:
;;; - [M-x vlf PATH-TO-FILE]
;;; - [C-c C-v] -- prefix.

(use-package vlf
  :ensure t
  :config
  ;; All VLF operations are grouped under the C-c C-v prefix by default. Hereâ€™s
  ;; example how to add another prefix (C-x v):
  ;; (eval-after-load "vlf"
  ;;   '(define-key vlf-prefix "\C-xv" vlf-mode-map))
