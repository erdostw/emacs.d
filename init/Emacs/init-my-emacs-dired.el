;; Another thing that did annoy me was the fact that when I traverse the
;; directory hierarchy, I leave a trail of open Dired buffers with all the
;; directories I go through. This is also easy to change: just enable the
;; `dired-find-alternate-file' function (bound to a in Dired) and use it to
;; visit a file or directory in place (IOW, open it instead of the current Dired
;; buffer â€“ this also works for files I want to visit!).
